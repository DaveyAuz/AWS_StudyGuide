# AWS Compute

## AWS Lambda

**AWS Lambda** provides a serverless computing environment, enabling developers to execute code in response to specific events without needing to provision or manage infrastructure. By automatically handling operational aspects such as scaling, patching, and administration, Lambda empowers developers to focus purely on business logic and code.

### What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is at the heart of the serverless movement in the cloud. "Serverless" does not mean there are no servers, but rather that you, as a developer or a business, don't have to deal with them. The infrastructure is abstracted away, leaving developers free to focus on building applications.

- **Event-Driven Model**: AWS Lambda is designed to use events like changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or updates in a DynamoDB table to trigger the execution of code. When the designated event occurs, Lambda executes the function asynchronously.

- **Stateless**: Each function execution is independent. AWS Lambda assumes no retention of state between function executions.

### Key Features

- **Event-driven**:
  - **Built-in Integrations**: AWS Lambda natively supports triggers from over a dozen AWS services, transforming the development of reactive applications.
  - **Custom Triggers**: With the Lambda API or custom integrations, developers can define custom event sources.
  - **Immediate Processing**: React to real-time data modifications, allowing for live responses and analytics.

- **Automatic Scaling**:
  - **Concurrent Executions**: Lambda functions can run code in parallel and process multiple events simultaneously.
  - **Provisioned Concurrency**: For latency-sensitive applications, you can ensure that there's always a warm container waiting to process an event.
  - **State Management**: For stateful processing, you can utilize services like Amazon ElastiCache or Amazon DynamoDB.

- **Serverless Framework**:
  - **Zero Administration**: Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale code with high availability.
  - **Built-in Fault Tolerance**: Lambda maintains compute capacity and infrastructure reliability, including monitoring, logging via Amazon CloudWatch, and automatic retries.
  - **Resource Specification**: You can set the amount of memory allocated to a Lambda function, and AWS Lambda allocates proportional CPU power, network bandwidth, and disk I/O.

- **Integrated Security Model**:
  - **IAM Roles**: Assign IAM roles to your Lambda functions to control permissions.
  - **VPC Access**: Run Lambda functions within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to access resources in a private environment.
  - **Encryption**: Data can be encrypted at rest and in transit.

### Use Cases

- **Real-time File Processing**: Automatically process, analyze, and route new files added to Amazon S3 buckets.
