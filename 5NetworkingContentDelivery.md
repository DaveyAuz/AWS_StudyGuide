## Amazon CloudFront

**Amazon CloudFront** is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by AWS. It securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds within a developer-friendly environment. CloudFront is integrated with other Amazon services, making it easier to use with applications that are built on AWS.

## Overview

- **Content Delivery**: CloudFront provides a global network of edge locations that cache copies of your content close to your users, ensuring faster delivery.
- **Integrated with AWS**: Seamlessly integrated with services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and AWS Elemental Media Services.
- **DDoS Protection**: Offers built-in security with AWS Shield Standard to protect your applications against DDoS attacks.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-as-you-go pricing with no long-term commitments or upfront fees.

## Key Features

### 1. **Edge Locations and Regional Caches**

- CloudFront uses a global network of 220+ Points of Presence (including Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches) across 90 cities in 47 countries.
- It routes user requests to the nearest edge location, ensuring the lowest latency delivery.

### 2. **Lambda@Edge**

- Run code closer to your customers without provisioning servers.
- Customize the content delivered via CloudFront with serverless functions.

### 3. **Security**

- Integrates with AWS security services like AWS Shield, AWS WAF, and Route 53 to provide a flexible and secure content delivery mechanism.
- Supports HTTPS and automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.

### 4. **Field-Level Encryption**

- Adds an extra layer of security by encrypting sensitive data at the application layer and ensuring that the encrypted data can only be decrypted by certain components of the system.

### 5. **Real-time Metrics and Logging**

- Get detailed visibility into the performance and health of your content delivery with CloudFrontâ€™s real-time metrics and AWS CloudTrail logs.

### 6. **Origin Fetches over HTTP/3**

- CloudFront supports HTTP/3 between the viewer and the edge location, and between the edge location and the origin, improving content delivery speed.

## Use Cases

- **Website Acceleration**: Speed up distribution of static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .php, and graphics files.
- **Video Streaming**: Stream live or on-demand video to a global audience.
- **API Acceleration**: Improve the speed and reliability of APIs served over CloudFront.
- **Software Distribution**: Deliver software updates and patches to users around the world quickly and reliably.
- **Custom Applications**: Use Lambda@Edge to build and deploy custom applications at the edge locations.

## Pricing

CloudFront follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Costs depend on several factors:

- **Data Transfer Out**: The volume of data delivered from CloudFront to viewers.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Requests**: The number of requests made.
- **Optional Features**: Some features, like Lambda@Edge, may incur additional costs.

Remember to regularly review AWS's official documentation and pricing page for the most accurate and up-to-date information on CloudFront and associated costs.
